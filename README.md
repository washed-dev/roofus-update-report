## Workflow automation for roofing sales
This tool is meant to automate certain tasks in the roofing sales process that currently have to be completed manually. These tasks include manual report generation, consolidating data from different sources, and image classification.

Currently I am focusing on integration with RoofLink, our CRM, and CompanyCam, the tool we use to upload photos.

More to come
